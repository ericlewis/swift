# Swift for Embedded Systems [![Build Status](https://jenkins.dragomirecky.com/job/swift-embedded/job/swift/badge/icon)](https://jenkins.dragomirecky.com/job/swift-embedded/job/swift/)

This is a fork of the [apple/swift](https://github.com/apple/swift) repository, enabling Swift to be used on bare metal.

This project is in a very early phase, and I am going to release more related repositories soon (together with updating this readme with installation instructions, etc.). However, if you want to know more right now, feel free to check out my thesis [Swift for Embedded Systems](https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/82498/F8-DP-2019-Dragomirecky-Alan-thesis.pdf).
